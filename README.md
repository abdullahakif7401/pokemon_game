Used and modified publicly available ADT implementations, constructed a few more ADTs, and observed how they are used in actual problem solving. Analyzed the algorithmsÂ best and worst-case complexity and put this information to use.

## Background
<br>
This is a two-player game. It entails assembling a team of various Pokemon in order to combat the team against another player until a winner is established. Teams may be created in various arrangements, and each player can only have up to six Pokemon on their squad. However, there is an odd limitation in that there are only three viable Pokemon selections to choose from.
